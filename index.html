	<h2> About Me  </h2> 
<h2>
</h2> I was born and raised in a smal;l town about 45 minutes east os Albuquerque. I am a sophomore this year at UNM. I am in the Accelerated Online Program and majoring in Business Admin at Andersons School Of Management. Next semester I plan on switching and going to main campus!  As far as my career goals I am not exactly sure of what I want to do but I do know that one of my long-term goals is to hopefully own my own business one day. Not sure what kind yet, my mind changes frequently with new ideas often.  

<h2> FunFact</h2>
I am a very family oriented person. So, when I have free time, I love visiting my grandma, cooking dinner with my mom, or watching movies with my family. Another thing about me is I love animals, especially dogs. My family and I have 4 German Shepard's and they are our pride and joy! Now don't get me wrong, I also enjoy my alone time too! I love winding down and regrouping after a long day.

Looking forward to working with all of you! 

Best, 

Carlyse
